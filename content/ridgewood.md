	Lenox Hill Radiology (LHR) | Ridgewood is our newest addition in Queens to LHR’s network of outpatient radiology centers located throughout the New York metropolitan area.&nbsp; Our goal is to provide state-of-the-art imaging services coupled with accurate diagnosis and efficient services.&nbsp; A full-service medical imaging center, this facility offers a complete range of imaging services including MRI/MRA, CT/CTA, calcium scoring, arthrogram, digital and 3D mammography, ultrasound, digital X-Ray, and DEXA for bone density measurement. We have the very latest in MRI technology with a Wide-Open 3.0 T MRI for claustrophobic and larger sized patients. The 3T MRI capability offers superior image quality for imaging difficult areas like the brain (neurological), small joints, large joints and muscle&nbsp; (musculoskeletal), and high resolution Prostate imaging.<br />&nbsp;<br />As in all of our locations, LHR Ridgewood offers 3D mammography (3D Tomo), the latest technology in breast cancer screening. Studies show that 3D mammography (3D Tomo) detects 40% more invasive cancers than traditional mammography alone.* So when it’s time for your annual mammogram, trust the 3D mammography experts at Lenox Hill Radiology.<br />&nbsp;<br />LHR Ridgewood is located less than ½ mile from Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, and is conveniently situated on the prominent corner of Myrtle Avenue and St. Nicholas Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are traveling by train, take the L or M trains to the Myrtle-Wyckoff Avenues station, which is 1 block away. If travelling by bus, the Q55 bus stops directly in front of our facility (Myrtle/St. Nicholas Ave.), and the B26 (Wyckoff/Palmetto St.) and Q58 (Putnam/Wyckoff Ave.) buses stop less than 2 blocks away.&nbsp; &nbsp;
