	When you come for your visit with us, your exam will be performed by one of our technologists. You will then consult with one of our NYC radiologists who, after studying your images, will meet with you and will review your medical history, perform a pertinent physical exam, discuss the interpretation of your results, make recommendations for follow-up, and answer your questions.

	After your visit here, your images will be reviewed by another radiologist within the group, and an official report will be transmitted to your referring physician.&nbsp;
