Our full-service imaging center&nbsp;offers a variety of services including MRI, Prostate MRI, CT, Nuclear Medicine, 3D Mammography, Ultrasound, DEXA (bone density), Fluoroscopy, Lung Screening (LDCT), Arthrography, Virtual Colonoscopy, and walk-in X-Ray.

	We are proud to continue the tradition of offering the highest level of care along with leading-edge technology with the introduction of advanced, non-invasive CT virtual colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy is a minimally invasive exam to screen for cancer of the large intestine.&nbsp;Patients may find virtual colonoscopy a fast and more tolerable&nbsp;colon cancer screening than a traditional endoscopic colonoscopy, which is commonly performed at an outpatient surgery center or hospital surgery suite.
