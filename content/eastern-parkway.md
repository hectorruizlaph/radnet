We are conveniently located on Eastern Parkway, situated between Utica Avenue and Rochester Avenue. If you are traveling by train, you can reach us by taking the 3, 4, or 5 trains to the Utica Avenue station, which is right across the street.

	We offer the latest in MRI technology with 3T Wide-Open MRI to accommodate all-size patients and/or claustrophobic patients. 3T MRI capability provides superior imaging quality for evaluating areas of the brain (neurological), small joints, large joints and muscles (musculoskeletal), and hi-resolution prostate imaging.
