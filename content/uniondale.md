	Welcome to LHR | Uniondale, one of Lenox Hill Radiology's newest diagnostic imaging centers on Long Island offering the latest in digital X-Ray technology.
</p><p>
	Digital X-Rays offer an immediate diagnosis of certain conditions with the smallest amount of radiation. There is little reason to worry about the small amount of radiation you will be exposed to when you receive a digital X-Ray. They provide virtually zero discomfort to the patient, and often with little to no preparation. Digital imaging gives us many advantages in handling your exam, including faster communication of results to your doctor. Digital imaging also allows your medical team to collaborate, if necessary, and to immediately compare previous exams with current ones, so that your health is properly monitored.
</p><p>
	Neighboring the Mitchel Athletic Complex, LHR | Uniondale will serve the communities of Hempstead, Uniondale, Westbury, and Garden City. LHR | Uniondale is part of Lenox Hill Radiology's large network of diagnostic imaging centers serving Long Island's communities of Bay Shore, Huntington, Massapequa, Patchogue, Plainview, West Islip, East Islip, and Hewlett as well as all the boroughs of New York.
